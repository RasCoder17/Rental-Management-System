An online property management portal has been created. Tenants can browse through the different properties like plots
, apartments, individual houses, offices, etc and can decide if they want to buy/rent them. Owners can add their properties 
onto the site to be sold.  The frontend for the website has been completed.

The backend part of the website has also been completed.  The databases for the different forms within the website will be 
integrated via a Xampp server. Session Handling, File Upload and Email sending have also been implemented in different ways. 
Validation for the forms and the payment module have been completed using Javascript.
Languages used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, PHP
Server: Xampp
Now, it is a functional property management portal.
